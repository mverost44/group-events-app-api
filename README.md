## Planning && Process
My first step towards tackling project 2 was generating a detailed plan of what my app should do, how an API would look, and how the front end would display the Api's requests.  Then I created and familiarized myself with user stories that described what features I would need. I started with the API, creating tables and relationships between them.  Once the API was functional, I created a front-end using bootstrap and javascript.  I sent requests to the API using AJAX and then parsing responses with handlebars and jQuery.

## Future Iterations
In future versions of this app I want to incorporate a more engaging style, mailers, and refactored code.

## User Stories:
1. As an event planner I want to be able to post an event.
2. As a member I want to view all of my groups events.
3. As a member I want to view all of the events I will be attending.

This app lets users create groups and events within those groups. Users can also join groups and events and enact CRUD actions on those they create.
